      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <h3>My Hobbies:</h3>
      <h4>I have many hobbies. But most favourite hobbies are:</h4>
      <h3>Reading books:</h3>
      <h4>
        My hobby is reading. I read whenever I have free time. I read many kinds
        of book such as history books, science books, sometimes, it is novel and
        popular magazines. Reading has a lot of advantages. First, reading is a
        cheap way to get information and entertainment. Moreover, you can keep a
        book forever and read it many more times. Thus, reading is a convenient
        way for me to acquire a wonderful source of knowledge. Futhermore,
        reading book will contribute to my vocabulary expansion. The more I
        read, the more words I exposure to, and they will inevitably make their
        way to my mind. That, therefore, also helps to improves my memory. When
        I read a book, I have to remember its plot, characters' name, events so
        that my memory will become much better. Additionally, reading book is
        the best way to set my mind at rest after a hard and gruelling day.
        These are some reasons why I am so into reading. And I think, anyone
        always sticking with their computer should step away from it for a
        little while, crack a book and replenish their soul for a moment.
      </h4>
      <h3>Listening Music:</h3>
      <h4>
        My hobby is listening music. I enjoy music and I listen it every single
        day. There are a lot of different styles of music for you to choose and
        enjoy. If I am in good mood, I prefer to listen some energy rock music
        that keep me happy and full of power. If I am tired, I chose some calm,
        relaxing songs. Music can speak, through music people can express
        feelings and emotions. When you hear something that looks like you, that
        you understand it easily, you start to love it. There are several
        different ways to enjoy music as your hobby. When you discover an artist
        or musician that you satisfies, itâ€™s clear that you want to collect all
        of their works. Not only listening to music, a music collection is a
        great hobby to have, too. Music is a hobby that has no boundaries. It
        makes the world smaller. Without music, life would be a mistake.

      <h4>
        My favourite food is Chicken Biryani. It is served with gravy and raita.
        It is a flavtinent dish that is popular around the world. Biryani is
        prepared from basmati rice mixed with several spices and cooked in a
        special way. Chicken Biryani, Mutton Biryani and Veg Biryani are some of
        the variants of this delicious dish. This dish is my favourite because
        it has a lip-smacking flavour and I love to eat it at least once a week.

      <h3>Ice Cream:</h3>
      <h4>
        Ice cream has always been my favorite dish and a delightful treat on a
        hot summer day. The smooth texture, the variety of flavors, and the cool
        sensation it provides make it an irresistible temptation for me. One of
        the reasons why ice cream is my favorite dish is because of its
        mouthwatering texture. The creaminess and the velvety feel of the
        dessert as it melts in my mouth are truly incredible. It is like a soft
        and smooth pillow of deliciousness that instantly brings a smile to my
        face. The texture of ice cream allows me to savor every spoonful and
        experience a moment of pure pleasure. Another aspect of ice cream that
        contributes to my love for it is the infinite possibilities of flavors
        to choose from. Whether it is classic flavors like chocolate, vanilla,
        and strawberry, or exotic combinations like salted caramel, cookie
        dough, or mint chocolate chip, there is always a flavor to suit any
        craving. I enjoy exploring new flavors and trying out different
        combinations, as it adds an element of surprise and excitement to the
        whole ice cream experience. The wide range of flavors allows me to
        customize my dish and indulge in my personal preferences. Not only does
        ice cream satisfy my taste buds, but it also provides me with a
        refreshing sensation, especially during the sweltering summer months.
        The coldness of the dessert soothes my palate and provides a temporary
        respite from the heat outside. It is like a mini-vacation for my senses,
        as I close my eyes and relish in the frosty delight that ice cream
        brings. Whether enjoyed on a cone, in a cup, or as part of a sundae, the
        coolness of ice cream is the perfect antidote to beat the summer heat.
        Furthermore, ice cream holds a special place in my heart as it is often
        associated with cherished memories and joyful moments. From childhood
        trips to the ice cream parlor with my family to celebrating birthdays
        with a big bowl of ice cream, these experiences evoke warm feelings of
        happiness and laughter. Ice cream has a way of bringing people together,
        creating a sense of unity and joy. It is a dish that is often shared
        amongst loved ones, enhancing the bond and creating beautiful memories.
        In conclusion, ice cream is undeniably my favorite dish due to its
        delightful texture, the vast array of flavors, the refreshing sensation
        it provides, and the memories it evokes. It is a treat that never fails
        to bring a smile to my face and adds a touch of sweetness to life's
        moments. Whether it is a simple scoop or a decadent sundae, ice cream is
        a never-ending pleasure that I will continue to savor with great
        delight.
