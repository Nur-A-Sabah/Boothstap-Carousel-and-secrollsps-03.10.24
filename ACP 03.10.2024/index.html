      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <h3>My Hobbies:</h3>
      <h4>I have many hobbies. But most favourite hobbies are:</h4>
      <h3>Reading books:</h3>
      <h4>
        My hobby is reading. I read whenever I have free time. I read many kinds
        of book such as history books, science books, sometimes, it is novel and
        popular magazines. Reading has a lot of advantages. First, reading is a
        cheap way to get information and entertainment. Moreover, you can keep a
        book forever and read it many more times. Thus, reading is a convenient
        way for me to acquire a wonderful source of knowledge. Futhermore,
        reading book will contribute to my vocabulary expansion. The more I
        read, the more words I exposure to, and they will inevitably make their
        way to my mind. That, therefore, also helps to improves my memory. When
        I read a book, I have to remember its plot, characters' name, events so
        that my memory will become much better. Additionally, reading book is
        the best way to set my mind at rest after a hard and gruelling day.
        These are some reasons why I am so into reading. And I think, anyone
        always sticking with their computer should step away from it for a
        little while, crack a book and replenish their soul for a moment.
      </h4>
      <h3>Listening Music:</h3>
      <h4>
        My hobby is listening music. I enjoy music and I listen it every single
        day. There are a lot of different styles of music for you to choose and
        enjoy. If I am in good mood, I prefer to listen some energy rock music
        that keep me happy and full of power. If I am tired, I chose some calm,
        relaxing songs. Music can speak, through music people can express
        feelings and emotions. When you hear something that looks like you, that
        you understand it easily, you start to love it. There are several
        different ways to enjoy music as your hobby. When you discover an artist
        or musician that you satisfies, it’s clear that you want to collect all
        of their works. Not only listening to music, a music collection is a
        great hobby to have, too. Music is a hobby that has no boundaries. It
        makes the world smaller. Without music, life would be a mistake.

      <h4>
        My favourite food is Chicken Biryani. It is served with gravy and raita.
        It is a flavtinent dish that is popular around the world. Biryani is
        prepared from basmati rice mixed with several spices and cooked in a

        the variants of this delicious dish. This dish is my favourite because
        it has a lip-smacking flavour and I love to eat it at least once a week.

      <h3>Ice Cream:</h3>
      <h4>
        Ice cream has always been my favorite dish and a delightful treat on a
        hot summer day. The smooth texture, the variety of flavors, and the cool
        sensation it provides make it an irresistible temptation for me. One of
        the reasons why ice cream is my favorite dish is because of its
        mouthwatering texture. The creaminess and the velvety feel of the
        dessert as it melts in my mouth are truly incredible. It is like a soft
        and smooth pillow of deliciousness that instantly brings a smile to my
        face. The texture of ice cream allows me to savor every spoonful and
        experience a moment of pure pleasure. Another aspect of ice cream that
        contributes to my love for it is the infinite possibilities of flavors
        to choose from. Whether it is classic flavors like chocolate, vanilla,
        and strawberry, or exotic combinations like salted caramel, cookie
        dough, or mint chocolate chip, there is always a flavor to suit any
        craving. I enjoy exploring new flavors and trying out different
        combinations, as it adds an element of surprise and excitement to the
        whole ice cream experience. The wide range of flavors allows me to
        customize my dish and indulge in my personal preferences. Not only does
        ice cream satisfy my taste buds, but it also provides me with a
        refreshing sensation, especially during the sweltering summer months.
        The coldness of the dessert soothes my palate and provides a temporary
        respite from the heat outside. It is like a mini-vacation for my senses,
        as I close my eyes and relish in the frosty delight that ice cream
        brings. Whether enjoyed on a cone, in a cup, or as part of a sundae, the
        coolness of ice cream is the perfect antidote to beat the summer heat.
        Furthermore, ice cream holds a special place in my heart as it is often
        associated with cherished memories and joyful moments. From childhood
        trips to the ice cream parlor with my family to celebrating birthdays
        with a big bowl of ice cream, these experiences evoke warm feelings of
        happiness and laughter. Ice cream has a way of bringing people together,
        creating a sense of unity and joy. It is a dish that is often shared
        amongst loved ones, enhancing the bond and creating beautiful memories.
        In conclusion, ice cream is undeniably my favorite dish due to its
        delightful texture, the vast array of flavors, the refreshing sensation
        it provides, and the memories it evokes. It is a treat that never fails
        to bring a smile to my face and adds a touch of sweetness to life's
        moments. Whether it is a simple scoop or a decadent sundae, ice cream is
        a never-ending pleasure that I will continue to savor with great
        delight.

        (Adinda Thomas), Ayu (Aghniny Haque), Bima (Achmad Megantara), Anton

        Narendra) the village head warns them not to cross the boundary of the
        forbidden gate, a gate leading to the footprint. The mysterious place
        may have something to do with the figure of a beautiful dancer who began
        to disturb Nur and also Widya. One by one began to feel the strangeness
        of the village. Bima began to change his attitude. Their KKN program is
        a mess, it seems that the unseen inhabitants of the village don't like
        them. Nur finally found an astonishing fact that one of them violated
        the most fatal rules in the village. The terror of the mysterious dancer
        figure became even more frightening, they tried to ask the help of Mbah
        Buyut (Diding Boneng) the local shaman, but it was too late, they
        threatened they would not be able to return safely from the village
        known as the dancer's village

        Australia, and North America. There are many famous tournaments which
        are played as well. The most widely known one is the FIFA world cup,
        which takes place every four years. I enjoy watching football and my
        favourite team is Argentina.

      <h4>Biomedical engineering:</h4>
      <h5>
        Biomedical engineering (BME) or medical engineering is the application
        of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology
        for healthcare applications (e.g., diagnostic or therapeutic purposes).
        BME is also traditionally logical sciences to advance health care
        treatment, including diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy. Also included
        under the scope of a biomedical engineer is the management of current
        medical equipment in hospitals while adhering to relevant industry
        standards. This involves procurement, routine testing, preventive
        maintenance, and making equipment recommendations, a role also known as
        a Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) or as a clinical engineer.
        Biomedical engineering has recently emerged as its own field of study,
        as compared to many other engineering fields. Such an evolution is
        common as a new field transitions from being an interdisciplinary
        specialization among already-established fields to being considered a
        field in itself. Much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of
        research and development, spanning a broad array of subfields (see
        below). Prominent biomedical engineering applications include the
        development of biocompatible prostheses, various diagnostic and
        therapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to
        micro-implants, imaging technologies such as MRI and EKG/ECG,
        regenerative tissue growth, and the development of pharmaceutical drugs
        including biopharmaceuticals.
